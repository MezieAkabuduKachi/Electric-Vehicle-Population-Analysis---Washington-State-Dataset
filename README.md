# Electric-Vehicle-Population-Analysis---Washington-State-Dataset


## Overview

This project analyzes the Electric Vehicle (EV) population data registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). The dataset includes key information about electric vehicles such as their make, model, range, and legislative district. The project demonstrates the data cleaning process, exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL, and data visualization with Power BI.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **VIN_1_10**: The first 10 characters of the Vehicle Identification Number.
- **County**: The county where the vehicle is registered.
- **City**: The city where the vehicle is registered.
- **State**: The state (Washington).
- **Postal_Code**: The postal code of the vehicleâ€™s registered address.
- **Model_Year**: The model year of the vehicle.
- **Make**: The manufacturer of the vehicle (e.g., Tesla, Nissan).
- **Model**: The specific model of the vehicle (e.g., Model S, Leaf).
- **Electric_Vehicle_Type**: Whether the vehicle is a Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) or a Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV).
- **Electric_Range**: The range of the vehicle on a single charge, in miles.
- **Base_MSRP**: The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of the vehicle.
- **Legislative_District**: The legislative district in which the vehicle is registered.
- **DOL_Vehicle_ID**: The unique vehicle ID assigned by the Department of Licensing.
- **Electric_Utility**: The electric utility provider serving the vehicle's registered address.

## Data Cleaning Process

1. **Removed irrelevant columns**: Only selected columns necessary for the analysis were retained.
2. **Handled missing data**: Rows with missing or null values were checked and either filled with appropriate default values or removed.
3. **Standardized column names**: Converted column names to a consistent format (snake_case).
4. **Corrected data types**: Ensured that numerical columns like `Base_MSRP` and `Electric_Range` are properly cast to numeric types.
5. **Resolved duplicates**: Duplicate records were identified and removed based on the `VIN_1_10` column.

## SQL-Based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this section, I used MySQL to explore the dataset through queries that reveal key insights into the electric vehicle population in Washington state. Some of the questions addressed in the analysis include:

1. How many electric vehicles are registered in total?
2. Which vehicle manufacturers (`Make`) have the most electric vehicles registered?
3. What is the distribution of electric vehicles by `Model_Year`?
4. Which cities have the highest number of registered electric vehicles?
5. What is the total number of vehicles for each type (`Electric_Vehicle_Type`)?
6. What is the average electric range (`Electric_Range`) by `Make` and `Model`?
7. What is the distribution of electric vehicles by `State`?
8. Which `Legislative_District` has the highest number of electric vehicles registered?
9. What is the maximum, minimum, and average `Base_MSRP` for electric vehicles by `Make`?
10. How many vehicles are registered per `County`?
11. How many vehicles were registered in each postal code (`Postal_Code`)?
12. What are the top 10 most popular electric vehicle models (`Model`) by registration count?
13. What percentage of electric vehicles are Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) versus Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV)?
14. What is the distribution of electric vehicles by `Electric_Utility` company?
15. How many electric vehicles have an electric range greater than 200 miles?
16. Which `Make` and `Model` has the highest `Base_MSRP`?
17. What is the average `Electric_Range` for vehicles in each `Legislative_District`?
18. Which vehicles have the same `Make` and `Model`, but differ in `Electric_Range` or `Base_MSRP`?
19. How many unique `VIN_1_10` entries are there in the dataset?



## Tools Used
